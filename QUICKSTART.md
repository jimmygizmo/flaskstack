# FlaskStack Quickstart

     docker-compose up
     
     http://localhost:48080

First you need to create a user before you can do anything.

Go to Register New User:

     http://localhost:48080/docs#/operations/users_new

Now you can use the username/password that was registere to get a login token.

Go to Create a new access and refresh token.
That is a fancy name for USER LOGIN:

     http://localhost:48080/docs#/operations/tokens_new

### Then you can use this token to use nearly all the other API endpoints.

See the live documentation and REST client utility at:

     http://localhost:48080/docs#/

Nearly all the details about using the API can be found here and all the APIs can be accessed through this web application. It's great for testin and learning about the API.
