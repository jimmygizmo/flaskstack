This is: python:3.10-slim
This is the new base image used in FlaskStack's flask container.

The prior image was:
This is the prior base image used by the Dockerfile we have set aside in this directory.

IMPORTANT: Almost immediately, these Dockerfiles will diverge in their commands/steps. I will experiment with
going back to using a Bitnami image soon and then may adapt the latest Dockerfile as needed.
** The Dockerfile preserved here in this directory is only kept here for easy reference. It is not
intended to but put back in place unmodified.
