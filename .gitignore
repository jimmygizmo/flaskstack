# IntelliJ IDE settings directory. You almost never want your IDE settings in the repository unless
# you have a very specific need like some helpful settings for an entire team to use and then,
# you need to account for the same directory being generated and modified by team members.
# Almost everyone simply excludes all IDE settings files and directories in all cases.
.idea/


# Directory to briefly hold working files inside the project but not add them to git.
# * Tell your IDE to exclude/ignore this directory to reduce indexing & inspection overhead.
# In IntelliJ IDEs, this is called "Mark as Excluded".

# pyenv
# I include instructions to use Pyenv to create the needed Pyenv Virtualenv.
# The .python-version file should be stored in the repo to help promote correct usage of Python and Pyenv for this project.
# Everyone should be using Pyenv for Python version management and management of VEs. It's the only way to consistently
# have all of your version match and it's the easiest way to manage VEs as well as your Python installations.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
